<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distraction Osteogenesis Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Distractors</li><li>External Distractors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Distraction Osteogenesis Devices market is primarily divided into two types: internal distractors and external distractors. Internal distractors are surgically implanted devices that are placed within the body, allowing for precise bone lengthening from the inside. They offer aesthetic advantages and reduced external visibility. External distractors, on the other hand, are attached outside the body and mechanically pull the bone segments apart over time. Both types are used to facilitate bone regeneration and treat various orthopedic and craniofacial conditions.</p></p>
