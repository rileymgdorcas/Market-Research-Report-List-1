<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dural Patch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Dural (Spinal) Membrane Patch</li><li>Non-absorbable Dural (Spinal) Membrane Patch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dural patch market is divided into two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable dural membranes. Absorbable dural patches are designed to be gradually absorbed by the body, supporting healing while minimizing the need for surgical removal. These typically promote tissue regeneration and reduce the risk of complications. In contrast, non-absorbable dural patches provide long-term support and structural integrity, remaining in place indefinitely. Both types are essential for addressing dural repairs in spinal and neurosurgical procedures, catering to varying patient needs and surgical scenarios.</p></p>
