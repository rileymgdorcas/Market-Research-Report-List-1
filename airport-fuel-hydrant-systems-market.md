<p><strong>The Airport Fuel Hydrant Systems Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nonprimary Airports (<10,000 Passenger Boardings/year)</li><li>Primary Airports (>10,000 Passenger Boardings/year)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The airport fuel hydrant systems market caters to two segments: nonprimary and primary airports. Nonprimary airports, with fewer than 10,000 passenger boardings annually, typically require smaller, efficient fuel delivery systems for limited operations. Conversely, primary airports, servicing over 10,000 passenger boardings yearly, demand more extensive and complex fuel hydrant systems to support high volumes of air traffic. Both segments focus on reliability, safety, and efficiency, but differ in scale and infrastructure needs based on passenger traffic.</p></p>
