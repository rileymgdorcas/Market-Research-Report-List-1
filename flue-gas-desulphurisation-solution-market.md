<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flue Gas Desulphurisation Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet FGD</li><li>Dry and Semi-Dry FGD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) market comprises three primary types: Wet FGD, Dry FGD, and Semi-Dry FGD. Wet FGD systems utilize a limestone slurry to absorb sulfur dioxide, producing a waste byproduct that can be processed further. Dry FGD employs a dry sorbent to capture SO2 without water, resulting in minimal waste. Semi-Dry FGD combines elements of both, using a dry reagent that creates a moist byproduct. Each type addresses sulfur emissions differently based on specific operational needs and environmental regulations.</p></p>
