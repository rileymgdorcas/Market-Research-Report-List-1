<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diaphragm Level Switch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Differential Pressure Switch</li><li>Static Pressure Switch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The diaphragm level switch market is primarily categorized into two types: differential pressure switches and static pressure switches. Differential pressure switches operate based on the variation in pressure between two points, providing precise level measurements by detecting changes in fluid levels. In contrast, static pressure switches measure the pressure exerted by a fluid column at a single point, making them suitable for applications where the level of fluid needs to be monitored without the influence of external forces. Both types enhance process control and safety in various industries.</p></p>
