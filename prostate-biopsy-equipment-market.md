<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prostate Biopsy Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>TRUS (trans-rectal ultrasound)</li><li>TPBX (trans-perineal)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The prostate biopsy equipment market primarily comprises two types: TRUS (trans-rectal ultrasound) and TPBX (trans-perineal biopsy). TRUS utilizes ultrasound technology to guide needles through the rectum, allowing for precise tissue sampling of the prostate. Conversely, TPBX is performed by accessing the prostate through the perineum, offering an alternative for patients with rectal issues or previous surgeries. Both techniques aim to increase diagnostic accuracy and minimize complications, catering to varying patient needs and clinical situations.</p></p>
