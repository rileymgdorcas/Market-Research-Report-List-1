<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horizontal Screw Conveyors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shafted Convoyers</li><li>Shaftless Convoyers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The horizontal screw conveyors market comprises two main types: shafted and shaftless conveyors. Shafted conveyors utilize a central shaft surrounded by helical screws, enabling efficient material transportation for bulk solids. They are ideal for applications requiring high pressure and heavy loads. Conversely, shaftless conveyors have an open design without a central shaft, allowing for more flexible material handling and reduced maintenance issues, making them suitable for sticky or viscous materials. Both types serve essential roles in various industries, enhancing productivity and efficiency.</p></p>
